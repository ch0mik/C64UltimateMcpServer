### Run Program (Load and Execute)
# Uses: Ultimate64Client.RunProgramAsync(file)
# MCP Tool: ultimate_run_program
# Loads program and starts execution
# Note: File must be uploaded to /Temp/ first

### Upload and Run PRG file in one operation
POST http://localhost:8080/
Content-Type: application/json

  "params": {
    "name": "ultimate_run_prg_binary",
    "arguments": {
      "filePath": "./examples_http/matrix.prg"
    }
  }
}

###
### Step 2: Run the program (executed automatically by step 1)
# Note: ultimate_run_prg_binary handles upload + execution in single call
# If you need to run again without uploading, use ultimate_run_program with /Temp/matrix.prg
